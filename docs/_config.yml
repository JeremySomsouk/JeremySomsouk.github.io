        description: |
          During my time at EPITA I learned the most teamwork and rigor which I try to carry on in my career. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this school and learned how to learn fast new technologies and becoming an all around engineer.

          Even though I did a specialization in security the last two years of school, I realized quickly that my main interest was still the software engineering.
