  Hi, my name's Jeremy and I'm a software engineer currently working at BlaBlaCar. I have worked for several companies gaining teamwork, hard skills but but above all soft skills to lead projects from the ground up.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Java</mark> and making <mark>phá»Ÿ</mark>

  And I am still learning how to be a <mark>great dad</mark> and that kind of leave me sleepless sometimes, but that is worth all the riches of the world.

        description: |
          During my time at EPITA I learned the most teamwork and rigor which I try to carry on in my career. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this school and learned how to learn fast new technologies and becoming an all around engineer.

          Even though I did a specialization in security the last two years of school, I realized quickly that my main interest was still the software engineering.
